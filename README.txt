Goatpad is a simple text editor and (mostly) a Notepad clone.

It has all core features that are expected of Notepad, with some missing features (deemed unimportant for core functionality, per my discretion).
It can open .txt files, .cfg files, and a few other kinds of files, probably depending on the encoding.
Does not prompt for a default extension to save as. User is responsible for extension management.

Shorcuts:

CTRL+S	Save as
CTRL+O	Open
CTRL+U	Undo
CTRL+Y	Redo
CTRL+C	Copy
CTRL+V	Paste
CTRL+X	Cut

Some shortcuts are provided through Windows functionality (Cut, copy paste) and some are hard-coded into the app.

To compile: Run the batch file, the .jar file will be created in the bin directory. If you want to run the program from the desktop, create a shortcut.
